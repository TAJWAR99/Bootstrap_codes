	On Sunday, unlike the other days of the week when he works, my dad spends the whole day with me watching football on TV.
	We even eat lunch together while watching. The highlight of the day is watching the Dolphins game.
	Dad and I get so excited, we yell and cheer together.On Sundays, I get to combine watching my favorite sport and
	spending time with my favorite person—what a great day!
